# Node.js Mentorship Program

I am a professional software engineer of 4 years and counting; the main language I have programmed in since I started working in the tech space professionally is Node.js. Over time, I have always thought about how Node.js works underneath and how it can be improved upon, this only intensified when I began to dabble into into other programming languages like Python and Java.

So, it's like a prayer answered when I saw the call for the Node.js mentorship programme.

In being part of this programme, I will get the opportunity to learn from people who have superior knowledge in this language and I will be able to pay it forward in my local community.

Thanks.
